The polaron simulation by CDFT in Rutile TiO2
The simulation of polaron localization and transfer behavior by constrained density functional theory
Initially, the calculation of polaron in static state reflecting the trapping energy and spatial distribution is performed.
Next, the parameters involving in the transfer rate such as reorganization energy, electronic coupling are investigated.
